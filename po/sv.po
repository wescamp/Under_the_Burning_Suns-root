"bosättning låg vid en av de fåtaliga oaserna. Vår by var kraftigt befäst mot "
"rövare, och vi kände inte till någon större bosättning. Min farbror Tanuil "
"var vår ledare under många år. Under hans ledarskap lärde vi oss att klara "
"oss själva och stå starka mot alla fiender. Vi var ett folk som kämpade i "

"splintering wood and screaming villagers. That night the sky rained flaming "
"rocks, boulders bigger than you could imagine. They smote the landscape like "
"lightning bolts, setting fire to whatever could burn and crushing houses, "
"walls, and elves. There was nowhere to hide, nowhere to go for protection. I "
"was so afraid, I thought that if I tried to flee I would be smashed, so I "
"hid and prayed to Eloh. I never prayed before as hard as I did that night. I "
"heard yells and screams outside, but I could not force myself to move. And "
"somehow, eventually the thin yellow tendrils of a sickly dawn stole over the "
"horizon, as if Naia herself were shocked by the devastation she saw."

"Jag kommer ihåg den natten som om det var igår. Jag är inte den som brukar "

"öronbedövande smällar, trä som trasades sönder och bybor som skrek. Det "
"regnade flammande stenar från himlen den natten, stenblock större än du kan "
"föreställa dig. De bombarderade landskapet som åskblixtar, och allt som de "
"rörde vi sattes i brand. De krossade hus, väggar och alver. Det fanns inte "
"någonstans att gömma sig, ingenstans att ta skydd. Jag var så rädd. Jag "
"trodde att om jag försökte fly, så skulle jag bli krossad, så jag gömde mig "
"och bad till Eloh. Jag hade aldrig bett så intensivt som den natten. Jag "
"hörde rop och skrik utifrån, men jag kunde inte röra mig. Och på något sätt "
"kom slutligen några tunna gula strimmor av en blek gryning över horisonten. "
"Det var som om Naia själv var förfärad av förödelsen."
