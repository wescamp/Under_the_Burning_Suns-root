"Chapter 1: I, Kaleh, grew up amidst the shifting sands, under our two suns "
"Sela and Naia. It was a land of hot dry days and cold nights, of roaming "
"horrors, where water was more valuable than gold. We had lived among the "
"sands ever since the forests fell eons ago. It was a hard savage land, but "
"we were tougher still, and we managed to survive settled around a rare "
"oasis. We had heavily fortified our village against any marauders and we "
"were the biggest encampment we knew of. My uncle, Tanuil, led us for many "
"years, and trained us to be self-sufficient and strong against all enemies. "
"A people struggling in an ocean of sand, we thought we were ready for "
"anything. All that changed one fateful night, when the sky rained fire..."

"I remember that night as if it were yesterday. I was not prone to dreaming, "
"but as I slept I had a strange vision. I didn't have long to ponder it "
"though, because I was woken in the dark by the sound of huge crashes, "
"splintering wood and screaming villagers. That night the sky rained flaming "
"rocks, boulders bigger than you could imagine. They smote the landscape like "
"lightning bolts, setting fire to whatever could burn and crushing houses, "
"walls, and elves. There was nowhere to hide, nowhere to go for protection. I "
"was so afraid, I thought that if I tried to flee I would be smashed, so I "
"hid and prayed to Eloh. I never prayed before as hard as I did that night. I "
"heard yells and screams outside, but I could not force myself to move. And "
"somehow, eventually the thin yellow tendrils of a sickly dawn stole over the "
"horizon, as if Naia herself were shocked by the devastation she saw."
