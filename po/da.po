"Chapter 1: I, Kaleh, grew up amidst the shifting sands, under our two suns "
"Sela and Naia. It was a land of hot dry days and cold nights, of roaming "

"sands ever since the forests fell eons ago. It was a hard savage land, but "
"we were tougher still, and we managed to survive settled around a rare "
"oasis. We had heavily fortified our village against any marauders and we "

"splintering wood and screaming villagers. That night the sky rained flaming "
"rocks, boulders bigger than you could imagine. They smote the landscape like "
"lightning bolts, setting fire to whatever could burn and crushing houses, "
"walls, and elves. There was nowhere to hide, nowhere to go for protection. I "
"was so afraid, I thought that if I tried to flee I would be smashed, so I "
"hid and prayed to Eloh. I never prayed before as hard as I did that night. I "
"heard yells and screams outside, but I could not force myself to move. And "
