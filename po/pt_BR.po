"though, because I was woken in the dark by the sound of huge crashes, "
"splintering wood and screaming villagers. That night the sky rained flaming "
"rocks, boulders bigger than you could imagine. They smote the landscape like "
"lightning bolts, setting fire to whatever could burn and crushing houses, "
"walls, and elves. There was nowhere to hide, nowhere to go for protection. I "
"was so afraid, I thought that if I tried to flee I would be smashed, so I "
"hid and prayed to Eloh. I never prayed before as hard as I did that night. I "
"heard yells and screams outside, but I could not force myself to move. And "
"somehow, eventually the thin yellow tendrils of a sickly dawn stole over the "
"horizon, as if Naia herself were shocked by the devastation she saw."
